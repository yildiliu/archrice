# notes on stow
Create a folder for every program you use in the dotfiles folder. It has to have the same structure
beginning from the HOME Path.

**Always pass the the target directory with** `stow -t ~`

`--adopt:` to apply new options **be careful using it**


Before applying the changes
```
-n: do not perform any operations that modify the filesystem.
stow --adopt -nvt ~ *
```
